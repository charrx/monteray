This is a replica of the macOS Monterey called Monteray(hehe), but presented in the browser.

I started using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for this project, but then later on decided to switch to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - now that React no longer recommends CRA for new projects.

I did it to kickstart my React experience and it felt easier to learn by doing.
